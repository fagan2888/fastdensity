##Getting started
these instructions will help you get a copy of the project, and make it run on your local machine for developpement and testing purpose. 
Please consult the licence of this project before.

###Prerequisites
What things you need for install the software, and where to find them, with some recommandation if you work with a windows OS)

####With Linux/Mac OS :
**_NEED TO BE CONFIRMED_**
(with those OS the package manager inside should manage alone the link between all the files needed)
```
other softs :
[Cmake](https://cmake.org/)
G++ : C++11 required

librairies (just install them using the package manager of your OS):
[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/()
[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/()
[openCV](https://opencv.org/()
```

####With Windows OS :
(working with windows may be slightly more complexe. Since there is no package manager include in the OS)
```	
other softs :
[Cmake](https://cmake.org/)
G++ : C++11 required (I recommand using [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/) which provide G++ and got high compatibility with Cmake)

librairies (I recommend to build them staticaly and store them in 2 folders "include" with the source C file .h, and "lib" with all .dll and .lib files) :
[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/()
[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/()
[openCV](https://opencv.org/()
```

###Installing
A step by step series of instructions that tell you how to get a development environnement running.

####With Linux/Mac OS :
**_TODO_**

####With Windows OS :
 1. [ ] First, "git clone" somewhere on your machine 
 2. [ ] Then download every libraries in a static way, and store them somewhere (see the prerequisites)
 3. [ ] Create a "build" folder wherever you want, it will contain all the builds of your project.
 3. [ ] Using Cmake (I recommand using the GUI in windows)
